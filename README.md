# Basic AI State Machine

 ## What is a State Machine?
A state machine is a conceptual model used in computer science to describe the behavior of a system. It consists of a finite number of states, transitions between states, and actions associated with each state or transition. State machines are widely used in various applications, including software development, robotics, and game development, to model complex behaviors and control systems.

Here's an example of creating a simple state machine that minimizes overhead by utilizing only one instance of each state.
